# Introduction

This repo contains the files associated with the django polling tutorial that can be found at https://www.djangoproject.com/.  I decided to name this project, MyPollingCompany, hence the name "mpc."  I am currently writing this to operate udner the following platforms.

1. Amazon Linux 1 with the Cloud9 IDE on its own EC2 instance.

# Instructions for Amazon Linux 1 with the Cloud9 IDE on its own EC2 instance

1.  git config --global user.name "your name"
2.  git config --global user.email "your email"
3.  git clone "the https URL from github"
4.  cd mpc
5.  ./amazon_linux1_cloud9_setup.sh
6.  Follow the instructions displayed at the conclusion of the script.`

# Notes

1. The files may contain multiple versions of content.  I did this so I could keep track of what changed throughout the tutorial.

2. I am usinmg MySQL for the backend.

# Security Considerations:

1. This is a demo and is not built with strong security in mind.
2. The passwords are short and are generated with pwgen.
3. Passwords are used on command lines - a strong no no!
